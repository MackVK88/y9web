<h2> Chosen Design </h2>

<p>

I will be using design two for multiple reasons. First, the two designs were similarily liked by my peers and family, but the second design is more capable for HTML coding. Also, many websites have similar designs to the first one and would like to see something different. And Finally, this design puts the stats more in the users hand and gives them the ability to see more stats at greater detail. Although both designs were strong, I choose the second one due to these reasons along with my personal opinion.
