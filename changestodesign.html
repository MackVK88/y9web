	<img src="FirstDesign.jpg" width="500px;height:500px;">
	<p> Changes to my design:</p>
	<li> There is a seperate tab for the map as the code was very to difficult to navigate with the map on the main tab</li>
	<li> I changed the how to help tab into a effects of urbanization tab as unfortunately there is little you can do to stop urbanization </li>
	<li> I added graphs to the website. I thought it was important to let the reader see different graphs, especially the environmental one</li>
	<li> Because I put a lot of focus into the map, I did not have a list of countries, but instead you would click on the map to see statistics</li>
	<li> Added another link that helps the reader fully understand urbanization before reading the graphs
