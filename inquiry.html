<h1> Urban Population Overtime </h1>
<h3> By: Mack McGregor </h3>


<hr> 

<h2> Explanation </h2> 

<p> The web is home to near unlimited data that is right at your fingertip. The reason some webpages get more viewers than others, is not to do with the data, but rather the visual appeal. When looking at the Global Health Organization (GHO), the webpage features hundreds of different data tables, all stored within one page. The problem with this webpage, is that there is just rows and rows on the data table which could be sorted much differently. The data I will be using is one on urban overpopulation over time. Urban overpopulation is a problem as this creates an uneven population distribution which can lead to overcrowding, or can cause harm to the environment due to the Urban heat island effect. The next paragraph will explain the need for this data to have a basic HTML5 canvas.  </p>

<h2> Justification </h2>

<p> HTML5 is a canvas used to draw graphics on a webpage. HTML5 is a good canvas to use for this data as it is supported by many different browsers. It also can create visually appealing graphs with medium code difficulty. To further prove, there is an id function that determines the width and height of the canvas. With all these as well as many different functions, HTML5 canvas is perfect to use with medium-low level code to create an awesome layout and webpage. It is important that this data becomes easier to read so people can understand the negatives surrounding urban overpopuation. </p>

<h2> Target Audience </h2>

<p> The target audience is towards people with good data such as the urban overpopulation, but has boring data, that is hard to read and digest. With basic HTML, CSS, And JavaScript code, and a proper canvas these web developers will be able to share their data with the world that is easy to understand and read. This code will help raise the issue of the data being shared. </p>

<h2> Primary Research / Skills </h2>

<p> In order to reach the full potential of the data, there are certain skills that I must develop. </p>
<li> Deepen my understanding of the canvas tag to create the best visual version of the data. </li>
<li> Learn the transitions, and although this will be difficult, it would help for my data as it is Urban overpopulation overtime, and would show the pace each country is on. </li>
<li> Finally, I must learn how to style different buttons, to create a unique user interface.</li>
<p> If these skills can be learned, then the webpage can be easy visually appealing and easy to read and understand.</p>

<h2> Range of Products </h2>

<p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/urbanization"> Our world in data </a> This website has a intriguing map. According to the legend, the countries in blue have a majority rural, and the countries in red have a majority urban. A good thing about this site is that is shows the countries change overtime, and how many transition from rural to urban. The code required for this seems difficult, but I believe if I can learn the transition function, I could create a webpage as strong as this one<p/>
<p><a href="https://www.unicef.org/sowc2012/urbanmap/"> Unicef </a> This another website that would require difficult code. Although this one may be further from reach than the other, the visual appeal is so strong that I believe would take hard work, but would come with great reward.<p/>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization_by_country"> Wikipedia </a> This website does not have a great canvas, but the graph creates easy to understand data. This would also take some time, but with canvas and transition, seems like a good goal to reach for<p/>

<p> These are three sky high webpages that will require dedication, but clearly show the urbanization overtime which gives the user a deeper understanding of the topic.

<h2> Design Brief </h2>

<p> Having rows and rows of data is not the most effective way to keep the reader engaged, and will thus not raise awareness about the issue being discussed in the webpage. My website will extract data from the <a href="http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.nURBPOP?lang=en"> WHO</a> and create a visualy appealing webpage. The user will be shown a picture of the world in the 19th century, and will see how they progress. The website will have limited tabular data. The information will be short and clear with limited scrolling. </p>
