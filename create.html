	<h1 align="center"> Please select one of the tabs above to learn about urbanization </h1>
	<p> According to the world health organization data (WHO) ever since 1950, more people have lived in rural areas than urban. There is a change afoot, and you need to know what it is. In the tabs above, you can understand what urbanization is. In the first tab, you can go to the index.html main menu, and have the option to see inquiry and analysis, and developing ideas stages. In the second tab, you see a map and can select a country and see the expected percentage of people to live in urban areas by 2050. In the third tab, you can learn more about urbanization by seeing multiple different explanatory graphs. In the fourth tab, you can check out the original data at the world health organization. And in the fifth tab, you can see my original website design and how I have altered it since the design. </p>
